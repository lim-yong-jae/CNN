# CNN

## fully convolution network  
Classifier using convolution layer, at last layer it uses fully connected layer. Fully connected layer can be replaced by convolution layer.

## kernel size (3,3) 
kernel size (7,7) can be implemented by using kernel size (3,3). Convolution operation with kernel size (3,3) being done 2 times is equal to Convolution operation with kernel size (7,7).
